# Testing Playbook (PPN)

Operator interpretation layer: what to look for, how to classify, and what results mean.

## What to look for
- Broadband shifts (system-wide)
- Narrowband spikes (resonance behavior)
- In-band mean/min/max changes (windowed effect)

## What counts as real
1) Repeatable
2) Cross-metric confirmation
3) Physically meaningful clustering (not single-point noise)
