# Phase 1 — Single Node (Plan)

Goal: Determine whether **water-driven vibration + geometry + material** produces measurable signatures:
- resonance peaks (acoustic/vibration)
- magnetic/EM changes correlated with excitation
- geometry-dependent mode shaping

## Controls (required)
1) No water, drive ON
2) Water ON, drive OFF
3) No water, drive OFF (baseline)
4) Dummy geometry control (non-pyramid or altered angles)

## Suggested bands
- 0–150 Hz initial scan (log sweep recommended)
