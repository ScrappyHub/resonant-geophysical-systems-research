# Phase 2 — Multi Node (Plan)

Goal: Test coupling between nodes:
- coherence / phase locking
- correlated spectral peaks
- drift correlation over time
- propagation delay estimates (if any)

## Controls
- identical nodes but isolated (no coupling medium)
- coupling medium only (no pyramid geometry)
- randomized drive patterns vs synchronized drives
