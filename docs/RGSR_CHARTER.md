# RGSR — Resonant Geometry & Stone–Water Resonance (Canonical Charter)

Author: Alec  
Project: Resonant Geometric Structures Research (RGSR)

## Prime Directive
Follow the data, not the narrative.  
If something extraordinary exists, it will appear as a stubborn pattern in boring numbers.

## Scope (What RGSR Is)
RGSR is a multi-domain experimental system designed to test whether geometry + materials + vibration + water can create organized, stable energy behaviors beyond simple mechanical resonance alone.

RGSR tests:
- stable frequency bands
- persistent resonance modes
- cross-domain coupling (vibration ↔ EM ↔ water motion)
- geometry-dependent localization and robustness under perturbation

RGSR does **not** assume:
- ancient power plants
- planetary grids
- mystical forces
- ley lines / consciousness / aliens

Planetary-scale effects (Earth rotation, alignment claims, etc.) are excluded unless forced by measured data after small-scale proof.

## Engine Stack (Five Coupled Engines)
1) Resonance Engine — find preferred modes, peaks, Q-factor, stability  
2) Geometry Engine — mode maps, nodal patterns, sensitivity to geometry changes  
3) Material & Water Engine — limestone/granite/water states; dry/humid/submerged/flow  
4) Coupling Engine — measure transfer & phase coherence across domains  
5) Stability & Perturbation Engine — identify what survives disruption

## Discovery Criteria
A “discovery” is:
- a frequency band that stays stable across changes
- coupled EM + vibration resonance that persists under perturbation
- geometry-dependent amplification/localization
- repeatable anomalies under controlled conditions

A “discovery” is **not** a story.

## Reproducibility Requirements
Every run must be:
- condition-profiled
- fully logged (inputs/outputs)
- hashed (conditions + key artifacts)
- comparable (Phase-1 vs Phase-2 deltas)
- anchored to git commit provenance
