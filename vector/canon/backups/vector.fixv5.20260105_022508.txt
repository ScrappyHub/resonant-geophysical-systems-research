Options:
  -c, --config <config>
          Read configuration from one or more files. Wildcard paths are supported. File format is
          detected from the file name. If zero files are specified the default config path

          [env: VECTOR_CONFIG_DIR=]

      --config-toml <config-toml>
          Read configuration from one or more files. Wildcard paths are supported. TOML file format

          [env: VECTOR_CONFIG_TOML=]

      --config-json <config-json>
          Read configuration from one or more files. Wildcard paths are supported. JSON file format

      --config-yaml <config-yaml>
          Read configuration from one or more files. Wildcard paths are supported. YAML file format
          is expected
          
          [env: VECTOR_CONFIG_YAML=]

  -r, --require-healthy <REQUIRE_HEALTHY>
          Exit on startup if any sinks fail healthchecks
          
          [env: VECTOR_REQUIRE_HEALTHY=]
          [possible values: true, false]

  -t, --threads <THREADS>
          Number of threads to use for processing (default is number of available cores)
          
          [env: VECTOR_THREADS=]

  -v, --verbose...
          Enable more detailed internal logging. Repeat to increase level. Overridden by `--quiet`

  -q, --quiet...
          Reduce detail of internal logging. Repeat to reduce further. Overrides `--verbose`

      --log-format <LOG_FORMAT>

      --color <COLOR>
          Control when ANSI terminal formatting is used.
          
          By default `vector` will try and detect if `stdout` is a terminal, if it is ANSI will be
          enabled. Otherwise it will be disabled. By providing this flag with the `--color always`
          option will always enable ANSI terminal formatting. `--color never` will disable all ANSI
          terminal formatting. `--color auto` will attempt to detect it automatically.
          
          [env: VECTOR_COLOR=]

--- probe: vector generate --help ---
Generate a Vector configuration containing a list of components

Usage: vector generate [OPTIONS] <EXPRESSION>

Arguments:
  <EXPRESSION>
          Generate expression, e.g. 'stdin/remap,filter/console'
          
          Three comma-separated lists of sources, transforms and sinks, divided by forward slashes.
          If subsequent component types are not needed then their dividers can be omitted from the
          expression.
          
          For example:
          
          `/filter` prints a `filter` transform.
          
          `//file,http` prints a `file` and `http` sink.
          
          `stdin//http` prints a `stdin` source and an `http` sink.
          
          Generated components are given incremental names (`source1`, `source2`, etc) which should
          be replaced in order to provide better context. You can optionally specify the names of
          components by prefixing them with `<name>:`, e.g.:
          
          `foo:stdin/bar:test_basic/baz:http` prints a `stdin` source called `foo`, a `test_basic`
          transform called `bar`, and an `http` sink called `baz`.
          
          Vector makes a best attempt at constructing a sensible topology. The first transform
          generated will consume from all sources and subsequent transforms will consume from their
          predecessor. All sinks will consume from the last transform or, if none are specified,
          from all sources. It is then up to you to restructure the `inputs` of each component to
          build the topology you need.

Options:
  -f, --fragment
          Whether to skip the generation of global fields

      --file <FILE>
          Generate config as a file

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
