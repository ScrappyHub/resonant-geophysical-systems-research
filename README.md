# 🧬 CORE ENGINE — RGSR GOVERNANCE (CANONICAL)

File: `verticals/rgsr/CORE_RGSR_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md`  
Engine Key: **RGSR**  
Engine Role: **FUSION_ENGINE**  
Authority Level: Engine Governance (Binding)  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL | ✅ SPECIAL CONSTRAINTS APPLY  

---

## 1. Authority & Inheritance (Absolute)

RGSR is permanently bound by CORE platform governance, including:

- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
- CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT.md  

RGSR defines **cross-domain correlation only**.

RGSR **does not create new physics**.

---

## 2. Engine Role Clarification (Critical)

RGSR is a **fusion and correlation engine**, not a primary truth generator.

RGSR:
- ingests sealed outputs from registered truth engines
- aligns, correlates, and compares them
- exposes coupling, coherence, and cross-domain relationships

RGSR **MUST NOT**:
- invent new physical quantities
- simulate physics already owned by a domain engine
- override or reinterpret raw engine outputs
- emit causal claims beyond correlation

> RGSR answers **“how domains relate”**, not **“what the physics is.”**

---

## 3. Permitted Inputs (Strict)

RGSR may ingest outputs **only** from CORE-registered engines:

- ARES  
- HYDRA  
- THERMOS  
- MAGNETAR  
- LITHOS  
- ATMOS  
- KINETIC  
- CRYSTAL  
- SIGNAL  

All inputs MUST:
- be sealed
- include verified hashes
- include engine_code + engine_version
- conform to registered OUTPUT_SCHEMA.json

RGSR MUST NOT accept:
- raw sensor data
- unsealed artifacts
- user-provided interpreted data
- external data feeds

---

## 4. Scope (What RGSR Is)

RGSR computes:

- cross-domain correlation
- coherence and phase alignment
- resonance overlap and coupling strength
- temporal alignment and lag relationships
- anomaly concurrence across engines
- confidence and consistency metrics

RGSR outputs are **relational**, never absolute truth.

---

## 5. Non-Scope (What RGSR Is Not)

RGSR MUST NOT:

- replace any domain engine
- generate standalone physical fields
- attribute cause, intent, or agency
- generate threat classification
- generate medical, military, or policy conclusions
- access network resources
- call other engines directly
- publish outside CORE permissions

---

## 6. Determinism & Reproducibility

RGSR runs MUST be reproducible given:

- identical sealed input artifacts
- identical correlation parameters
- identical engine release identity

If stochastic or heuristic methods are introduced:
- they MUST be declared in ENGINE_MANIFEST.json
- they MUST be logged in RUN_CONDITIONS.json
- they MUST be disabled by default unless a lane explicitly permits them

---

## 7. Required Artifacts (Minimum Sealed Bundle)

RGSR MUST emit a sealed bundle including:

- `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`
- `RUN_CONDITIONS.json`
- `INPUT_INDEX.json` (list of all input artifacts + hashes)
- `OUTPUT_CANONICAL.json`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- `ARTIFACT_INDEX.json`

Recommended domain artifacts:
- `COUPLING_MATRIX.json`
- `COHERENCE_MAP.json`
- `PHASE_ALIGNMENT.json`
- `ANOMALY_OVERLAP.json`
- `CONFIDENCE_METRICS.json`

RGSR MUST NOT emit raw engine data; only references + derived correlations.

---

## 8. Safety & Misuse Controls (Enhanced)

RGSR MUST:

- clearly label correlation vs causation
- include confidence and uncertainty metrics
- prohibit “root cause” language in outputs
- prohibit predictive claims unless routed through governed lenses
- prohibit single-domain dominance bias

RGSR outputs MUST be framed as:
> “Observed cross-domain relationships under stated conditions.”

---

## 9. Publishing & Export Rules

RGSR has **no independent publishing authority**.

Export is permitted only when:
- all input artifacts are sealed and verified
- RGSR output is sealed
- manifest + schemas are included
- CORE lane policy explicitly authorizes export

Restricted lanes (defense, medical, security) require additional governance approval.

---

## 10. Amendment Rules (Highest Scrutiny)

Any change to:
- RGSR scope
- permitted inputs
- output semantics
- determinism guarantees
- correlation methods

REQUIRES:
- governance review
- registry update
- versioned manifest
- Git audit record

Unreviewed changes invalidate RGSR runs.

---

## 11. Final Constraint Declaration

RGSR is a **physics integrator**, not a simulator.  
RGSR is a **correlation system**, not an authority.  
RGSR exists to reveal structure — not to decide meaning.

Once committed, this file is **locked engine governance**.
