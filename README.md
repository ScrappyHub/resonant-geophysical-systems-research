# 🧬 RGSR — Resonant Geophysical Systems Research Engine

RGSR is a **multi-domain fusion engine** within the CORE Engine Family.

RGSR performs **cross-engine correlation**, not primary physics simulation.

---

## Engine Role

**Engine Type:** FUSION_ENGINE  
**Domain:** Cross-domain resonance & correlation  
**Governance Owner:** CORE Platform  
**Execution Context:** CORE-orchestrated only

RGSR ingests sealed outputs from registered engines and computes relationships
between domains.

---

## What RGSR Computes

RGSR computes:

- cross-domain correlation
- coherence and phase alignment
- resonance overlap and coupling strength
- temporal alignment and lag relationships
- multi-engine anomaly concurrence
- confidence and consistency metrics

RGSR **does not create new physics**.

---

## What RGSR Does NOT Do

RGSR does NOT:

- generate raw physics fields
- override or reinterpret engine truth
- accept raw sensor data
- infer causation or attribution
- produce policy, medical, or defense conclusions
- publish independently
- call engines directly

RGSR outputs are **relational only**.

---

## Determinism & Reproducibility

RGSR runs are reproducible given identical:

- sealed input artifacts
- correlation parameters
- engine version

Heuristic or stochastic methods must be declared and gated by CORE.

---

## Inputs & Outputs

Inputs:
- sealed outputs from CORE-registered engines only

Outputs:
- correlation matrices
- coherence maps
- coupling metrics
- confidence indicators

RGSR never emits raw engine data — only references and derived relations.

---

## Governance

RGSR operates under enhanced constraints defined by CORE governance law.

All outputs are interpretive and must be framed as correlations.

---

## License & Use

RGSR is a governed scientific fusion engine.

Ungoverned or standalone use is unsupported.
