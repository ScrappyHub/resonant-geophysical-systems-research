# ENGINE GOVERNANCE (ACKNOWLEDGEMENT) — RGSR

This engine is permanently bound by:
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md
- CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT.md

## Hard Prohibitions
This engine MUST NOT:
- create/manage identities
- enforce roles/tiers
- bypass CORE audit
- alter sealed artifacts
- call other engines directly
- access network resources
- infer user/governance state

## Domain Scope
RGSR computes correlation-only fusion across declared engine outputs. It must not generate new physics. Any classification is a CORE policy lens, not engine output.
