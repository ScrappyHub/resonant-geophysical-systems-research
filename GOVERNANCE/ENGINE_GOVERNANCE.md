# ENGINE GOVERNANCE — RGSR (FUSION ENGINE)

Authority Level: Engine Governance (Highest Scrutiny)  
Engine Role: FUSION_ENGINE  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL | 🚨 SPECIAL CONSTRAINTS  

---

## 1. GOVERNANCE INHERITANCE (ABSOLUTE)

RGSR is permanently bound by CORE governance:

- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT.md  
- CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md  

RGSR has **no independent authority**.

---

## 2. ENGINE ROLE (CRITICAL DISTINCTION)

RGSR is a **fusion and correlation engine**.

RGSR:
- ingests sealed outputs from registered engines
- computes relationships between domains
- exposes coupling, coherence, and alignment

RGSR DOES NOT:
- create new physics
- override engine truth
- reinterpret outputs
- generate causal claims

Correlation ≠ causation.

---

## 3. PERMITTED INPUTS (STRICT)

RGSR may ingest outputs ONLY from:
- CORE-registered engines
- sealed artifacts
- schema-validated payloads

RGSR MUST NOT:
- ingest raw sensor data
- ingest unsealed artifacts
- ingest user-interpreted data
- access external feeds

---

## 4. PROHIBITIONS (ENHANCED)

RGSR MUST NOT:
- attribute cause, intent, or agency
- generate threat, medical, or policy conclusions
- privilege one engine as “dominant truth”
- access networks
- publish independently
- call engines directly

---

## 5. DETERMINISM & AUDITABILITY

RGSR outputs MUST be reproducible given:
- identical sealed inputs
- identical correlation parameters
- identical engine version

Heuristics or probabilistic logic:
- must be declared
- must be logged
- must be gated by CORE lane policy

---

## 6. OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS

RGSR outputs:
- relationships
- confidence metrics
- correlation structures

RGSR MUST:
- label uncertainty
- explicitly state correlation-only semantics
- reference input artifacts by hash

---

## 7. CHANGE CONTROL (STRICTEST)

Any change to:
- scope
- permitted inputs
- output semantics
- correlation logic

REQUIRES:
- governance review
- registry update
- versioned manifest
- Git audit record

Unregistered changes invalidate RGSR runs.

---

## 8. FINAL DECLARATION

RGSR is a **physics integrator**, not an authority.

It reveals structure.
It does not decide meaning.

This file permanently constrains RGSR behavior.
