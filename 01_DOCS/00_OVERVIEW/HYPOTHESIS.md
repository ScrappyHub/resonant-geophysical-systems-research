# Core Hypothesis (Working)

Ancient pyramid complexes may have functioned as **environment-driven resonant structures** coupling:
- moving/pressured water (mechanical excitation)
- geometry (standing waves / cavity modes)
- materials (dielectric + piezoelectric response)
- ground conduction pathways (faults/aquifers)

This project does NOT assume a conclusion.
It defines experiments to detect:
- resonance amplification
- water → vibration coupling
- vibration → EM / magnetic anomalies
- geometry-dependent effects
